I feel accomplished when I see things integrating nicely with other things. :)\r\n\r\nI believe it’s very important for both developers and system administrators to try to build an experience on both software development and system administration fields. It's crucial to understand software from ’both ends’.\r\n\r\nAfter an experience in a local ISP I moved to a consulting company which gave me the opportunity to travel around Italy and work within some Telcos companies like Nokia Italy, Vodafone Italy, Logica CMG, FastWeb. At that time I also enjoyed working with linux based embedded devices and developing kernel space modules to control them (ie LEDs, buttons, etc).\r\n\r\nAfter a while I got frustrated of the way things were done in Italy, and I realized that I needed to move abroad to try to boost my career.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to risk everything moving to Ireland in 2008 where I found a place as Deployment Engineer in Newbay Software, where I spent my ~3 years working on projects like AT&T Mobileshare and Telstra Tribe occasionally traveling to the US and Germany.\r\n\r\nI currently work in Facebook, in the Site Reliability Operations team where my main responsibility is to look after the 1st website of the world, improve internal tools, and our efficiency.\r\n\r\n### What you'll find in my `github`\r\n\r\nYou'll mostly find snippet of code, old projects, etc.\r\n\r\n### Contact me\r\n\r\n* [Facebook profile](http://www.facebook.com/pallotron)\r\n* [Linkedin profile](http://ie.linkedin.com/in/pallotron/)\r\n* [Personal website](http://www.pallotron.net)\r\n* [Blog](http://blog.angelofailla.com) -- mostly italian\r\n* Email at pallotron@freaknet.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
